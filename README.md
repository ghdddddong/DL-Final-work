# This has been a fantastic class, and we've all gained a lot! 

Ever since receiving the assignment, our group members began researching relevant literature, continuously modifying and debugging the code, striving to produce a well-structured, logically sound, and content-rich final paper for the course. 
In the end, we successfully completed this satisfying report as we had hoped. 
However, we still have many areas for improvement and intend to further delve into this aspect in the future to continuously enhance our abilities. 

# Thank you to every teacher! We appreciate you.
